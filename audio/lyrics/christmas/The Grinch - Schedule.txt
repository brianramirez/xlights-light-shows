Nerve of those Whos
Inviting me down there
On such short notice
Even if I wanted to go
My schedule wouldn't allow it

Four o'clock wallow in self pitty
Four thirty stare into the abyss
Five o'clock solve world hunger
Tell no one
Five thirty Jazzercise
Six Thirty Dinner with me
I can't cancel that again
Seven o'clock wrestle with my self loathing
I'm booked
Of course if I bump the loathing to nine
I could still be done in time to lay in bed stare at the ceiling and slip slowly into madness
But what would I wear?

It's not a dress it's a kilt
Sicko!

Stupid
Ugly
Out of Date

This is ridiculous
If I can't find something nice to wear
I'm not going

Oh!
Ah!
Mmm!

That's it I'm not going.
